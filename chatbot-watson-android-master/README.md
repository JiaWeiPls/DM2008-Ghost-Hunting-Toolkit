#Find Me app developed by Theodore & Jia Wei for DM2008 Final Project
The Find Me android application was inspired by ghost hunting.​
Ghost hunting is the process of investigating locations that are reported to be haunted by ghosts.
Typically, a ghost-hunting team will attempt to collect evidence supporting the existence of paranormal activity.
Ghost hunters use a variety of electronic devices, including EMF meters, digital thermometers, both handheld and FM Radios.​

Amongst the software used is IBM Cloud & Firebase.
